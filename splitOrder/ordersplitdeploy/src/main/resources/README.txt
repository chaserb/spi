This folder is where you should drop your Safeguard order *.pdf
files. The splitter utility will read every *.pdf file in this 
folder, and create a *.processed.pdf file for each one it finds.

The *.processed.pdf file will have all the orders found in its
corresponding *.pdf file, but will print each order on the
top of its own page.

If there there happens to already be a *.processed.pdf file in
this folder for a given *.pdf file, the splitter utility will 
simply overwrite the processed file.
